The elastic processing capabilities of Sumo Logic enables users to collect and manage log data from various sources, regardless of type, volume, or location.

## Key Features

1) Data Monitoring & Troubleshooting : Analyze and visualize data from applications, infrastructure, and network environments
2) Elastic Processing : Handle large-scale log data processing across different data types and sources
3) Real-Time Insights : Gain actionable intelligence into online operations, customer behavior, and security threats

## Contributing Content

For detailed instructions, including our style guide, see [Contributor Guidelines](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/contributing).

We recommend forking our repo, creating a new branch for your content changes, and submitting a pull request. We will help review, test, and merge the content for publishing.

1) Fork the Repository : Creates a copy of the repo under your GitHub account.
2) Create a Branch : Make sure to work on a new branch in order to keep your changes more organized.
3) Make Your Changes : Edit the code or documentation directly from your branch.
4) Submit a Pull Request : Once you have done all your changes, submit a pull request to the original repo so the team can review it.

## Contribution Guidelines
All contributions should adhere to the [Contributor Style Guide](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/contributing/style-guide/). Make changes that are concise and also informative, especially when contributing new topics.

## Building Locally

Docusaurus requires the following to build on locals:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 16.14
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5, you can install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you have that installed: `brew install yarn`

The site includes translations into other languages. To build on your local:

1. Clone the repo using Git or tools like GitHub Desktop.
1. In a terminal, change to the cloned repo folder. Run the install command: `yarn install`.
1. To serve and review your content, use one of the following:
   * Use start, hot reloads as you make changes: `yarn start`. Any issues with broken links and images are listed according to file. Locate and update those issues, then run build and start again to verify.
   * Use npm serve to test and review multi-languages: `npm run serve`. This build does not hot reload and requires a rebuild to test and review.
1. To build locally and test your links, run `yarn build`.   

The static files are generated in the `build` folder and run on your local machine at: `http://localhost:3000/`. To stop the build or served site, hit Ctrl + C to interrupt. You can enter new commands in terminal, rebuild, and restart.

Sumo Docs was created using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) with React, Rehype, and Remark plugin support. Our CLA bot was built using [cla-bot](https://colineberhardt.github.io/cla-bot/).

## Publishing Content

As pull requests are merged to the `main` branch by the Sumo Logic Doc team, the content builds and deploys to a staging site. This allows you to review and test your content thoroughly on a server, rather than a local build, prior to merging your code to production.
